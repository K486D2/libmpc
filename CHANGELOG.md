# Changelog

## [0.4.2] - 2024-01-14
### Added
- Added examples to show how to use the library

### Fixed
- Fixed the cmake target configuration to properly target the library

## [0.4.1] - 2024-01-30
### Changed
- Removed coloured output for the integrated logger
- Configure script now can be used to avoid the installation of the test suite

### Fixed
- Fixed dockerfile to use the 0.6.3 version of the OSQP solver

## [0.4.0] - 2023-05-20

### Added
- Added profiler to measure statistics of the optimization problem
- In linear mpc is now possible to override the warm start of the optimization problem
- Added support for OSQP warm start in linear mpc

### Changed
- The linear mpc parameters now allows to enable the warm start of the optimization problem
- The mpc result structure now contains a status field to check if the optimization problem has been solved
- CMakelists.txt has been refactored to export the INCLUDE_DIRS variable

## [0.3.1] - 2023-03-06

### Fixed
- The computation of the scalar multipler was not correct

## [0.3.0] - 2023-03-04

### Added
- Added new api in linear mpc to add a scalar constraints

### Changed
- In linear mpc the last input command is now used to initialize the optimal control problem

### Fixed
- The default value for the box constraints in linear mpc are now set -inf and inf
- In linear mpc optimal input sequence was erroneously the delta input sequence

## [0.2.0] - 2023-01-09

### Added
- Improved performances of non-linear mpc
### Changed
- Added support in non-linear for output penalization in objective function (Breaking change)
- In non-linear prediction step index is now available in the model update function (Breaking change)

##Â [0.1.0] - 2022-11-12
### Added
- Added support in linear mpc to define the references, weights, constraints and exogenous inputs different in each prediction step
- Added general support to the retrival of the optimal sequence (state, input and output)

### Changed
- The API to set the references, weights constraints and exogenous inputs using vector now requires a span of the horizon (Breaking changes)
- Added new APIs to define the references, weights, constraints and exogenous inputs matrices to the whole horizon
