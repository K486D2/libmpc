# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - 2023-03-04

## Added
- Added new api in linear mpc to add a scalar constraints

## Changed
- In linear mpc the last input command is now used to initialize the optimal control problem

### Fixed
- The default value for the box constraints in linear mpc are now set -inf and inf
- In linear mpc optimal input sequence was erroneously the delta input sequence

## [0.2.0] - 2023-01-09

### Added
- Improved performances of non-linear mpc
### Changed
- Added support in non-linear for output penalization in objective function (Breaking change)
- In non-linear prediction step index is now available in the model update function (Breaking change)

##Â [0.1.0] - 2022-11-12
### Added
- Added support in linear mpc to define the references, weights, constraints and exogenous inputs different in each prediction step
- Added general support to the retrival of the optimal sequence (state, input and output)

### Changed
- The API to set the references, weights constraints and exogenous inputs using vector now requires a span of the horizon (Breaking changes)
- Added new APIs to define the references, weights, constraints and exogenous inputs matrices to the whole horizon
- Internal structure of the library has been refactored to separate non-linear and linear classes
